# electron-bch-wallet-single-addr
This is a web-based single page app (SPA) written in React. It provides non-custodial wallet features for the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, including support for SLP tokens and NFTs. It is forked from [bch-wallet-web3-android](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-web3-android), but modified. The android components have been removed and replaced with [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) to convert the web app to a Desktop application.


## Installation
